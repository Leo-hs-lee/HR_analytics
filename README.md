Introduction
Employee attrition and performance are key factors that determine the success of an organization. High attrition rates can lead to a loss of valuable knowledge and resources, while poor employee performance can affect productivity and overall business outcomes. This project aims to use HR analytics to identify the factors influencing attrition and performance, and provide data-driven recommendations for improving employee retention and satisfaction.

Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the IBM HR Analytics Employee Attrition & Performance dataset, which is publicly available on the IEEE DataPort. The dataset contains information on 1,470 employees and 35 features, including demographics, job role, work environment, and performance metrics. The target variable for attrition is binary, indicating whether an employee has left the company or not.

Installation
To get started, clone this repository to your local machine:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your_username/hr-analytics.git
This project requires Python 3.6+ and the following packages:

pandas
numpy
matplotlib
seaborn
scikit-learn
You can install these packages using pip:

Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
To run the project, execute the main.py script:

css
Copy code
python main.py
This will load the dataset, preprocess the data, and generate summary statistics and visualizations.

Data Analysis
After loading and preprocessing the dataset, the analysis.ipynb Jupyter notebook is provided for in-depth data analysis and visualization:

Copy code
jupyter notebook analysis.ipynb
The notebook includes code for exploring data distributions, correlations, and identifying key factors related to employee attrition and performance.

Predictive Modeling
The predictive_modeling.ipynb Jupyter notebook contains code for building and evaluating machine learning models to predict employee attrition:

Copy code
jupyter notebook predictive_modeling.ipynb
Various classification algorithms are explored, with their performance evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

Results
The results of the project, including insights, visualizations, and model performance metrics, can be found in the results folder. This folder is automatically generated after running the analysis.ipynb and predictive_modeling.ipynb notebooks.
